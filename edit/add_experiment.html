<h2>How to Add A New Experiment</h2>

<h3>1. Create a GitHub account</h3>
<p>
If you already have a GitHub account you can skip this step. Go to <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub.com</a> and create a new account. Make sure you have your email addres verified - GitHub will send you an email to verify your email address and you should click a link in this email.
</p>

<h3>2. Fork MEL Science website repository</h3>
<p>
Open the MEL Science website repository at <a href="https://github.com/MELScience/melscience.github.io/">https://github.com/MELScience/melscience.github.io/</a> and click the <b>Fork</b> button on the top. It will create your own copy of the website (such copies called forks in GitHub). Since now on you will edit your own copy and only after you have made all the needed changes and test it you will add the changes to the main website.

<h3>3. Create "gh-pages" branch</h3>
<p>
Before editing the website you need to make one more technical step: create a new branch called "gh-pages". It is needed to tell GitHub to handle this repository as a website which will be helpful for you in order to test how your changes look like on the website. Click the <b>branch: master</b> combobox and enter <b>gh-pages</b> in the appeared edit field to create a new branch. Please note that it is important that create branch has exactly this name.

<h3>4. Open the "experiments" folder</h3>
<p>
After you have forked the website repository and created "gh-pages" branch open the "experiments" folder. 
</p>
<p>

</p>

<h3>5. Create a new experiment file</h3>
<p>
Click the "+" link on the top of the "experiment" folder page. 
</p>
<p>

</p>

<h3>6. Choose experiment file name</h3>
<p>
The experiment file name should be descriptive, all small letters, use "-" symbol between the words and end with ".html" file extension. Here are samples of good experiment file names:
<ul>
  <li>ammonium-chloride-smoke.html</li>
  <li>burning-of-sugar-cube-with-ash-as-a-catalyst.html</li>
  <li>catalytic-oxidation-of-acetone-on-copper-wire.html</li>
  <li>flameless-burning-of-hexamine-fuel-tablet-with-cr2o3-as-a-catalyst.html</li>
  <li>preparation-of-hydrogen-using-hydrochloric-acid-and-zinc.html</li>
</ul> 
</p>

<h3>8. Update experiment id and experiment name in the file</h3>
<p>
Copy/paste your file name without ".html" file extension to <b>id</b> value (the first line). Edit the <b>experiment_name</b> (the third line).
</p>

<h3>9. Save your changes</h3>
<p>
Press the <b>Commit new file</b> button on the bottom of the page. 
</p>
<p>

</p>

<h3>10. Test the first draft version</h3>
<p>
Now a new experiment page is created. You can test it online in your copy. Its link is:
<pre>
https://[your_login].github.io/melscience.github.io/experiments/[your_page_name].html
</pre>
</p>
<p>

</p>

<h3>12. Edit: add links</h3>
<p>
Search for webpages that contain description of this experiment. Please include not more than 10 link and include only those webpages that contain experiment description not generic information about this reaction. For each link add the following three lines to the <b>links</b> section:
<pre>
  - link: [webpage_url_here]
    title: "[webpage title here]"
    language: en
</pre>
</p>

</pre>
</p>
<p>
Please remove all unneeded parameters from YouTube URL. URL must be only in the form as above.
</p>

<h3>14. Edit: description</h3>
<p>
Add experiment description that contains information how to make this experiment and some science background. Please check other experiment descriptions for the style. You can use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a> in the description.
</p>

<h3>15. Edit: category</h3>
<p>
Select one of <a href="https://github.com/MELScience/melscience.github.io/tree/master/categories">the following categories</a> for the experiment and add it to the <b>category</b> field.
</p>

<h3>16. Edit: reaction formula</h3>
<p>
Put <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_equation">reaction formula</a> into the <b>reaction</b> field. Please use the following notations:
<ul>
  <li>Use ↑ symbol for appeared gases</li>
  <li>Use ↓ symbol for precipitate</li>
  <li>Use <b>=[catalyst]=</b> to show that this reaction require a catalyst, add catalyst name instead of <b>catalyst</b> (for example: <b>=[Pt]=</b>)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>17. Edit: reagents</h3>
<p>
Check if the needed reagents are already described in <a href="https://github.com/MELScience/melscience.github.io/tree/master/reagents">the list of reagents</a>.  If not <a href="howtoedit_add_reagent.html">create new reagent pages</a> for missed reagents. Add list of all used reagent ids into the <b>reagents</b> section.
