step_by_step: |
 Put some drops of universal indicator in the U-tube and add filtered water. The solution should be yellow-green.
 Add a few drops of acid in the one end  and a few drops of base in the second end of tube.
 Universal indicator changes colors to show the pH level of a substance. In this case, when you mixed an acidic solution with a basic one, the indicator made a colorful spectrum  from dark blue to red.
