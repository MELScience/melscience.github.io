    title: Flying Fiery Tea Bags
    language: en
step_by_step: |
  1. Take a paper tea bag. Remove the clip and thread or cut off the  top of the bag. 
  2. Remove the tea from the bag.
  3. Form the bag into a cylinder with a space in the center.
  4. Set it upright on a flat, non-flammable surface.
  5. Use a lighter or match to set the top on fire.
safety_description: |
  Wear eye protection goggles. There is a some fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready.
science_background: |
  Paper bags burn by the reaction:
  (C6H10O5)n + 6n O2 --> 6n CO2 + 5n H2O
  Warm air and gases accumulate inside the cylinder and rise up. The  force of this current isn't enough to lift the tea bag until it's  almost completely burned. Once the ash tea bag skeleton burns  thoroughly, it becomes light enough for the convection current to  launch it into the air.
