id: steel-wool-fire
mel_id: MEL000002
type: experiment
experiment_name: Steel wool fire
category: burning
reaction: Fe + O2 = Fe2O3
description: |
  In normal conditions iron is not flammable. Thus you cannot ignite a nail. It is because a normal piece of iron has very small surface which is not enough to self-sustain its burning. But steel wool consists of very thin threads which have enough surface area that heat produced is self-sustaining.
explosion: 0
color_change: 0
fire: 1
precipitate: 0
gassing: 0
smoke: 0
catalyst: 0
phases: gas+solid
trick: |
  You can start fire using a 9V battery, just touch the positive and negative terminals of a 9V battery against the steel wool.  
comments:
safety: |
  Temperatures of steel wool and fire in this experiment could exceed 1,000&deg;C (1800&deg;F). Wear eye protection.
