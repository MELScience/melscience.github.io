id: ammonium-chloride-smoke
mel_id: MEL000001
type: experiment
experiment_name: Smoke of ammonium chloride
category: smoke
reaction: HCl + NH3 = NH4Cl↓ 
description: |
  The diffusion of hydrogen chloride and ammonia gas through air to form ammonium chloride smoke
explosion: 0
color_change: 0
fire: 0
precipitate: 0
gassing: 0
smoke: 1
catalyst: 0
phases: gas
trick: Smoke disappears in one glass and reappears in another glass
comments: It could also be used for gas diffusion speed demonstration. 
safety: |
  Both used liquides concentrated ammonia solution and concentrated hydrochloric acid are very corrosive. If either of these liquids comes into contact with your skin, flush with copious amounts of water. Wear goggles. If you get some in you eyes, immediatly flush with water for at least 15 minutes and seek medical attention. Vapors of both the used liquides are dangerous. Avoid breathing the vapors.
