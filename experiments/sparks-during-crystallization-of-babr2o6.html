experiment_name: Sparks during crystallization of Ba(BrO3)2
category: sparks in solutions
reaction: 2KBrO3 + BaCl2 = Ba(BrO3)2↓ + 2KCl
description: |
  First you have to prepare barium bromate Ba(BrO3)2 from the more affordable materials, potassium bromate KBrO3 and barium chloride BaCl2. 
  Since the solubility of the first is small, it is necessary to take dilutions of about 3% concentration. 
  When you cool down the reagent mixture, the desired solt falls down as a precipitate: in cold water barium bromate is almost insoluble. 

  Filter, wash with cold water and dry out the received barium bromate. 
  Then take 2 g, dissolve in 50 ml of boiling water and re-filter the solution. 
  Take a glass with the solution and cool it down to 40-45&deg;C. 
  Blue sparks and pop souns will appear in the the solution at this temperature.
