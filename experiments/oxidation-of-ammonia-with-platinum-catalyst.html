type: experiment
experiment_name: Oxidation of ammonia with platinum catalyst
category: burning
reaction: 4NH3 + 5O2 =[Pt]= 4NO + 6H2O 
description: |
  Put a small amount of concentrated ammonia solution into a beaker.
  Take a platinum wire and make a construction that you can easily put inside the beaker.
  Heat the platinum wire in a flame until it glows red and put in the beaker.
  Ammonia is oxidized by oxygen on the platinum wire surface. The platinum wire acts as a catalyst in this reaction which generates a lot of heat to make the wire glowing red hot.

comments: 
safety: |
  Concentrated aqueous ammonia can cause burns and is irritating to the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract. 
  Wear eye protection.
  The resulting nitrogen dioxide is an extremely toxic gas by inhalation. Avoid breathing it. 
  Perform this experiment outside, in a fume hood or in a well ventilated room.
