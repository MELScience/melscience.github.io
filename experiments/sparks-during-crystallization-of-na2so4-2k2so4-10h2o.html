experiment_name: Sparks during crystallization of Na2SO4 * 2K2SO4 * 10H2O
category: sparks-in-solutions
reaction: 2K2SO4 + Na2SO4 + 10H2O = Na2SO4 * 2K2SO4 * 10H2O ↓
description: |
 If you get hot solution of K2SO4 and Na2SO4 solts and start to cool it down in the dark you will see a lot of sparks during the crystallization of the double salt:

 2K2SO4 + Na2SO4 + 10H2O = Na2SO4 * 2K2SO4 * 10H2O

 In order to make it take 108 g of potassium sulfate K2SO4 and mix it with 100 g of sodium sulfate decahydrate Na2SO4 * 10H2O (Glauber's salt) and add portionwise under stirring a little hot distilled or boiled water until all the crystals are dissolved. 
 Leave the solution in the dark for cooling and crystallization of the double salt Na2SO4 * 2K2SO4 * 10H2O. 

 Once crystals begin to stand out, the solution will spark: at 60&deg;C is weak, and as it cools stronger and stronger. When the crystals fall out a lot, you will see a shower of sparks. If you hold a glass rod to stand out on the bottom of the vessel crystals then reappear spark. Luminescence and sparks due to the fact that during the crystallization of the double salt released a lot of energy, almost completely converted into light.
