step_by_step: |
  1. Prepare six glasses containing a small amount of six solutions: potassium thiocyanate, barium chloride, potassium ferrocyanide, tannic acid, tartaric acid and sodium bisulfite.
  2. Prepare a solution of ammonium iron(III) sulfate in a jug.
  3. Pour the solution from the jug into the glasses.
safety_description: |
  Wear lab gloves and eye protection.  
science_background: |
  The solution of ammonium iron(III) sulfate contains Fe(3+) and SO4(-) ions. There are thiocyanate, barium, ferrocyanide, sulfide ions, tannic and tartaric acids in the glasses.
  Potassium thiocyanate reacts with Fe(3+) ions and forms a dark-red colored solution, which contains [Fe(SCN)](2+) ions.
  Barium and sulfate ions form the crumbly barium sulfate precipitate. The final solution looks dense and light-yellow colored.
  Potassium ferrocyanide with Fe(3+) ions forms a red colored complex Fe[Fe(CN)6] solution.
  Tannic acid is a big molecule with many OH-groups and it coordinates with Fe(3+).  The deep -blue colored solution looks like ink.
  Tartaric acid coordinates with Fe(3+) ions and forms a yellow complex.
  HSO3(-) ions are produced from sodium bisulfite and a red solution of  iron(III) hydrogen sulfite solution is formed.
