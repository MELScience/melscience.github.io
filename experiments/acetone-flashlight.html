step_by_step: |
  1. Put a small amount of acetone into a beaker.
  2. Take a copper wire and make a construction that you can easily put inside the beaker. The wire should hang about 1 cm from the acetone surface. It the wire is closer it could igniting the acetone.
  3. Heat the copper wire in a flame until it glows red and put in the beaker with acetone without touching its surface.
  4. Acetone vapor is oxidized by oxygen on the copper wire surface. The copper wire acts as a catalyst in this reaction which generates a lot of heat to make the wire glowing red hot. 
safety_description: |
  Perform this experiment outside, in a fume hood or in a well ventilated room. Please note that acetone is a highly flammable liquide. 
  There is a serious fire risk - a fire extinguisher should be ready. You must prevent the hot copper wire from igniting the acetone. 
  Keep all flames away from the open vessel with acetone.
  The reaction products are toxic by inhalation. Wear eye protection.
science_background: |
  Heated copper catalyses oxidation of acetone vapour on the metal surphase.
