step_by_step: 

1) Weigh out separately 9 g of propane-1,3-dioic (malonic) acid, 8 g of potassium bromate(V) and 1.8 g of manganese(II) sulfate-1-water on weighing boats or watch-glasses.
2) Place the beaker of dilute sulfuric acid (10 wt%)on a magnetic stirrer and stir the solution fast enough for a vortex to form.
3) Add the malonic acid and potassium bromate(V).
4) When these have dissolved, add the manganese(II) sulfate and observe what happens.
5) A red colour should develop immediately. This will disappear after about one minute.
6) Thereafter the colour will oscillate from red to colourless with a time period of about 20 seconds for a complete oscillation. This will continue with a gradually increasing time period for over ten minutes.

A Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction is one of a class of reactions that serve as a classical example of non-equilibrium thermodynamics,
 resulting in the establishment of a nonlinear chemical oscillator.
 The only common element in these oscillating systems is the inclusion of bromine and an acid.
 The reactions are theoretically important in that they show that chemical reactions do not have to be dominated by equilibrium thermodynamic behavior.
 These reactions are far from equilibrium and remain so for a significant length of time. 
 In this sense, they provide an interesting chemical model of nonequilibrium biological phenomena, and the mathematical models
 of the BZ reactions themselves are of theoretical interest.
 The theory of oscillating reactions is complex and not fully understood.
 The overall reaction is usually given as:
3CH2(COOH)2(aq) + 4BrO3–(aq) → 4Br–(aq) + 9CO2(g) + 6H2O(l)
The oxidation of the malonic acid by the bromate(V) ions is catalysed by manganese(II) ions, and manganese(III) ions are produced as intermediates.
Some references claim that the red colour is due to molecular bromine which could be produced via the following two steps:
Br–(aq) + BrO3–(aq) + 2H+(aq) → HBrO2 + HBrO(aq)
Br–(aq) + HBrO(aq) + H+(aq) → Br2(aq) + H2O(l)
However, other detailed studies of the processes occurring give a variety of colourless bromate ions and bromic acid molecules as intermediates, rather than bromine itself, so it is therefore possible that the red colour is due to something else, maybe the transient existence of Mn3+ions which are known to be red/purple in colour.
The colour oscillation is brought about by two autocatalytic steps, which are highly complex in nature and have been the cause of several advanced research projects over the past 30 years or so.
